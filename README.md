Sales Analysis Dashboard 📊
📝 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data. The goal was to transform raw data into a visual story that helps stakeholders understand sales trends, product performance, and customer segmentation.

🎨 Design Process (UI/UX)
Before building the dashboard, I used Figma to design the user interface. This ensured:

User-Centric Layout: Intuitive navigation between Overview, Product, and Customer views.

Visual Hierarchy: Clean and modern look with a consistent color palette.

Prototyping: Mapping out the user journey from the landing page to detailed reports.

🚀 Key Features
Interactive Navigation: Sidebar menu to toggle between Sales Overview, Product Details, and Customer Analysis.

KPI Tracking: Real-time visibility into Total Sales ($2M), Total Profit ($286K), and Total Orders (10K).

Sales Trends: Yearly growth analysis (2015-2018) using area charts.

Category Performance: Breakdown of sales and profit by Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies.

Top Customers & Sub-Categories: Identification of high-value clients and best-selling items like Phones and Chairs.

🛠 Tools Used
Design: Figma (UI/UX Design & Prototyping).

Data Analysis: Power BI.

Visuals: Donut Charts, Area Charts, Tree Maps, and Bar Charts.
